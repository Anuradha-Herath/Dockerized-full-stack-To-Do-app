# Rate Limiting and Development Issues - Fixed

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. Rate Limiting Too Restrictive
**Problem**: The rate limiter was set to only 100 requests per 15 minutes for general endpoints and 50 for auth endpoints, causing "429 Too Many Requests" errors during development.

**Solution**: 
- Modified rate limiting to skip in development environment
- Increased limits in `.env` file:
  - `RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=10000` (from 100)
  - `AUTH_RATE_LIMIT_MAX=1000` (from 50)
- Added skip logic for development environment in `server.js`

### 2. Favicon.ico 404 Errors
**Problem**: Browsers automatically request `/favicon.ico`, which was hitting the API and contributing to rate limit issues.

**Solution**: Added a favicon handler in `server.js`:
```javascript
app.get('/favicon.ico', (req, res) => {
  res.status(204).end(); // No content
});
```

### 3. CORS Issues in Development
**Problem**: CORS was too restrictive for development testing.

**Solution**: Modified CORS configuration to allow all origins in development environment.

### 4. Environment Configuration
**Problem**: `NODE_ENV` wasn't properly set, so development optimizations weren't applying.

**Solution**:
- Added `NODE_ENV=development` to `.env` file
- Created proper npm scripts for Windows
- Added development logging middleware

### 5. Backend Auto-Restart Issues
**Problem**: Server needed manual restart after changes.

**Solution**: 
- Using nodemon properly with development environment
- Rate limiting skipped in development
- Added development logging to track requests

## Files Modified:

1. **backend/.env** - Updated rate limiting values and added NODE_ENV
2. **backend/server.js** - Added development-specific rate limiting skip, favicon handler, improved CORS, and development logging
3. **backend/package.json** - Added proper Windows-compatible npm scripts
4. **frontend/.env** - Created with proper API URL configuration

## How to Run in Development:

### Windows (PowerShell):
```powershell
cd "backend"
$env:NODE_ENV="development"
npm run dev
```

### Or use the batch file:
```cmd
cd backend
start-dev.bat
```

## Verification:

1. ✅ Rate limiting disabled in development
2. ✅ Favicon requests handled properly
3. ✅ CORS relaxed for development
4. ✅ Environment variables properly configured
5. ✅ Development logging active
6. ✅ Auto-restart with nodemon working

The server should now handle frequent requests without rate limiting issues and automatically restart when you make changes to the code.
